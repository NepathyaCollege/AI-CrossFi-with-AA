# Hackathon Project: ETHGLOBAL2024 Superhack

This folder contains all the contracts written for the hackathon Superhack 2024.

## Aim of the current project
- Buy tokens at a specific price.
- Use different tokens for buying and triggering.
- Every pool is on V2, but the system can be easily extended to others.

All other coins except USDT are only minted and have liquidity on V2 pools.

### Key Points

1. **Main Router per Chain**: 
   - Each blockchain network has a primary router that handles operations such as cross-chain token transfers.
   - The routers on different chains communicate through defined "lanes," which represent the pathways between two chains.

2. **Pools with Burn Authority**:
   - Each pool on the network is authorized to burn tokens as part of the cross-chain transfer process.
   - These pools hold tokens and are equipped with a CCIP receiver, ensuring proper handling and transfer of assets across different networks.

3. **Current Implementation**:
   - **Base to Sepolia**: The system is currently functional for transfers from the Base chain to Sepolia.
   - **Sepolia to Base**: The reverse operation (Sepolia to Base) is not functional due to issues with Thirdweb, a platform we're using for deployment and testing.
   - **Authorization**: We've implemented an `onlyAuthorized` modifier, ensuring that only approved entities can call specific functions within the pool, especially those related to receiving tokens. Due to the Thirdweb issue with Sepolia, we havenâ€™t been able to fully test this functionality.

### Router and Lane Configuration

- **BaseSepolia**:
  - **Router Address**: [`0xFC32a5413768594E1B7b750A21a62C84dFa04D13`](https://sepolia.basescan.org/address/0xFC32a5413768594E1B7b750A21a62C84dFa04D13)
  - **Lane to Sepolia**: `16015286601757825753`

- **Sepolia**:
  - **Router Address**: [`0x7E53B7303BE4665F2C674314f203410E4d9f7A52`](https://sepolia.etherscan.io/address/0x7E53B7303BE4665F2C674314f203410E4d9f7A52)
  - **Lane to Base**: `10344971235874465080`



- **Automation Tasks**:
  - Automatically triggering token purchases when certain price conditions are met.
  - Managing cross-chain messages and ensuring they are executed at the correct time.
  - Handling the process of burning tokens in the appropriate pool based on the transfer direction.

- **Automation Configuration**:
  - Chainlink Automation is used to monitor the price feeds for various tokens like BTC, ETH, and LINK.
  - Specific conditions are set up within the smart contracts to automatically initiate actions when these conditions are met.
  
- **Price Feeds**:
  - **BTC Price Feed**: `0x1b44F3514812d835EB1BDB0acB33d3fA3351Ee43`
  - **ETH Price Feed**: `0x694AA1769357215DE4FAC081bf1f309aDC325306`
  - **LINK Price Feed**: `0xc59E3633BAAC79493d908e63626716e204A45EdF`

- **Automation Logic**:
  - **Token Purchase Automation**: The contracts are configured to automatically purchase tokens when their prices reach a specified threshold, using Chainlink Automation to monitor price feeds and trigger transactions.
  - **Cross-Chain Automation**: The system leverages Chainlink's capabilities to handle the timing and execution of cross-chain messages, ensuring seamless operations across different networks.
